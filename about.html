        <h4>We're a team of Northwestern University School of Law students focused on bringing software into the legal world so we can dramatically cut the costs of legal services for entrepreneurs and startups. Meanwhile, real lawyers can focus on the big questions that pay the big bucks.</h3>
        <p class=about><font color=#5cb85c>Economical.</font> Sure, software is eating the world. That's why we believe in bringing software to the legal industry. Everyone should be able to afford quality incorporation documents, bylaws, employee agreements, etc., and software can scale that up in a way no law firm ever could. Cost-effective gets you in the door. But what are we doing to keep you here?</p>
        <p class=about><font color=#5cb85c>Quality.</font> Software means nothing if we're not delivering quality legal content to you. We've studied what top firms and attorneys do and created a set of templates and default clauses that any VC would be happy to see. You'll see things like double-trigger acceleration and 4-year vesting periods in our templates. All the standard Silicon Valley lingo your startup needs to be successful. We know what startups need and we're continually developing products to address these needs in a cost-effective manner.</p>
        <p class=about><font color=#5cb85c>Community.</font> At Clocktower, we're not just automating legal processes. We're building a community of support, a place where entrepreneurs with aspirations for accelerated growth can come with questions, comments or concerns. We're building a community of entrepreneurs with newly formed corporations, all with hopes of scaling a business.</p>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
        </center>
        <p class="about">We've developed a few simple products to begin providing quick and personal legal advice to entrepreneurs, but we're nowhere near finished. We envision a future where a user can log in, access personalized learning modules, and have access to a large library of content, educating users on a variety of legal issues. An AI-powered recommendation algorithm will help sort users through all of this content, finding the modules most relevant to the user, while also helping identify legal risks the user may not have known his or her business had. </p>
