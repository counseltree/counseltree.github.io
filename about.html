        <h3>We're a team of four Northwestern Law students focused on making legal education accessible to small businesses so they can address legal issues and get back to running their business.</h3>
        <p class=about>Legal questions are extremely common in day-to-day business operations at medium-sized and growing companies. Managers often struggle with how to resolve these questions because the resources available to them are ill-suited to aiding the decision-making process. For most issues, effective managers don’t need to be legal experts, they need a minimum amount of education necessary to make an informed decision.</p>
        <p class=about>Currently, reputable resources that provide a wide scope of service (in-house general counsel or calling an attorney at an expensive firm) are prohibitively expensive for our target segment. These companies have likewise outgrown the scope of less-expensive (and less personalized) online legal resources.</p>
        <p class=about>Managers need an educational resource that provides them with (1) the information necessary to move forward with their business or (2) the peace of mind that utilizing a more expensive legal resource is a prudent business decision. Counseltree aims to provide that to businesses.</p>
        <p class=about>Our first product offering is a simply Q &amp; A form where an employee can ask a question and give some more information about their business. Within 24 hours, Counseltree will research the question and provide the user with the most relevant resources and information available to succinctly answer the question so that the employee can become more educated on the topic. Counseltree is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice: we aim to help our users become more educated on the legal issues they're facing so that they can make more informed business decisions or have more useful conversations when they do seek the advice of an attorney. While we plan on offering Counseltree as a paid subscription service, right now we are in a free, invite-only test phase. Enjoy our free product, and let us know how we can improve!</p>
