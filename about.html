        <h4>We're a team of Northwestern University School of Law students focused on bringing software into the legal world so we can dramatically cut the costs of services for entrepreneurs and startups. Meanwhile, real lawyers can focus on the big questions that pay the big bucks.</h3>
        <p class=about><font color=#5cb85c>Economical.</font> Sure, software is eating the world. That's why we believe in bringing software to the legal industry. Everyone should be able to afford quality incorporation documents, bylaws, employee agreements, etc., and software can scale that up in a way no law firm ever could. Cost-effective gets you in the door. But what are we doing to keep you here?</p>
        <p class=about><font color=#5cb85c>Quality.</font> Software means nothing if we're not delivering quality legal content to you. We've studied what top firms and attorneys do and created a set of templates and default clauses that any VC would be happy to see. You'll see things like double-trigger acceleration and 4-year vesting periods in our templates. All the standard Silicon Valley lingo your startup needs to be successful. We know what startups need and we're continually developing products to address these needs in a cost-effective manner.</p>
        <p class=about><font color=#5cb85c>Community.</font> At Clocktower, we're not just automating legal processes. We're building a community of support, a place where entrepreneurs with aspirations for accelerated growth can come with questions, comments or concerns. We're building a community of entrepreneurs with newly formed corporations, all with hopes of scaling a business.</p>
