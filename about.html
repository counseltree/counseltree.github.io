        <h3>We're a team of Northwestern University School of Law students focused on making legal education accessible to entrepreneurs with growing businesses so they can address legal issues and get back to running their business.</h3>
        <p class=about>Legal questions are extremely common in day-to-day business operations at growing companies. Leaders often struggle with how to resolve these questions because the resources available to them are ill-suited to aiding the decision-making process. For most issues, effective managers donâ€™t need to be legal experts, they simply need education on the legal risks at play so they can make an informed decision. "Khan Academy for the Law." That's our tagline, and we're sticking to it.</p>
        <p class=about>Reputable resources that provide a wide scope of service (in-house general counsel or calling an attorney at an expensive firm) are prohibitively expensive for our target segment. These companies have likewise outgrown the scope of less-expensive (and less personalized) online legal resources.</p>
        <p class=about>Managers need an educational resource that provides them with (1) the information necessary to move forward with their business or (2) the peace of mind that utilizing a more expensive legal resource is a prudent business decision. Counseltree aims to provide that to businesses.</p>
        <p class=about>Our first products are centered around providing quick, personalized legal education. First, we've developed a simple Q &amp; A form where an individual can ask a question and give some more information about his or her business. Within 24 hours, Counseltree will research the question and provide the user with the most relevant resources and information available to succinctly answer the question and become more educated on the topic. Our second product is a chatbot that walks a user through the process of hiring his or her first employee. Counseltree is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice: we aim to help our users become more educated on the legal issues they're facing so that they can make informed business decisions or have more useful conversations when they do seek the advice of an attorney. While we plan on offering Counseltree as a paid subscription service, right now we are in a free test phase. Enjoy our product, and let us know how we can improve!</p>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
        </center>
        <p class="about">We've developed a few simple products to begin providing quick and personal legal advice to entrepreneurs, but we're nowhere near finished. We envision a future where a user can log in, access personalized learning modules, and have access to a large library of content, educating users on a variety of legal issues. An AI-powered recommendation algorithm will help sort users through all of this content, finding the modules most relevant to the user, while also helping identify legal risks the user may not have known his or her business had. </p>
